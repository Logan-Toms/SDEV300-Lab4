# SDEV300-Lab4

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script developed as part of my college coursework. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and my ability to perform various matrix operations using NumPy, along with input validation for phone numbers and zip codes. This coursework is part of my Building Secure Python Applications (SDEV 300) class at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To facilitate matrix operations (addition, subtraction, matrix multiplication, and element-by-element multiplication) on 3x3 matrices.
- To validate user inputs for phone numbers and zip codes.
- To provide an interactive user interface for continuous matrix computation until user exit.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Matrix Operations**: Performing various matrix operations using NumPy.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring user inputs for phone numbers and zip codes are in the correct format using regular expressions.
- **User Interaction**: Creating an interactive command-line interface for user engagement.
- **Python Programming**: Writing modular and reusable code with functions for different operations.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Enhance Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, improving my understanding of matrix operations and input validation.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Abilities**: Developed solutions for validating user inputs and performing complex matrix calculations.
- **Develop User Interfaces**: Learned to design and implement effective command-line interfaces for user interaction.

## Files Included
- `sdev_wk4_lab4.py`: The main Python script that includes functions for matrix operations, input validation, and interactive user interface.

## Usage Instructions
To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Logan-Toms/SDEV300-Lab4.git
    cd SDEV300-Lab4
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python sdev_wk4_lab4.py
    ```

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
    - Enter your phone number and zip code when prompted.
    - Enter two 3x3 matrices.
    - Choose a matrix operation to perform (addition, subtraction, matrix multiplication, or element-by-element multiplication).
    - View the results, including the matrix, its transpose, and the mean values of its rows and columns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **NumPy**: A library used for matrix operations and numerical computations in Python.
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: Used for input validation of phone numbers and zip codes.
